    "text": "The NBA sparks major debates on who is the best player, scorer, defender, rebounder, passer, and more. This season, Tyrese Haliburton is the best and most efficient passer in the NBA.

The ball gets stolen when in the player’s possession or when passing to another player. Haliburton has the second lowest number of these mistakes out of the top players in assists. The player lower? Tyus Jones who has 222 less assists than him. Haliburton rarely makes dangerous passes or uses excessive dribbles. His decisions translate to less careless play by the Pacers.\n\n\nCode\nlineup &lt;-   lineups[[\"Lineups\"]] |&gt; mutate_at(6:34, as.numeric) \nwithHali &lt;- lineup |&gt; \n  filter(grepl(\"Haliburton\", GROUP_NAME)) |&gt; \n  group_by(TEAM_ABBREVIATION) |&gt;\n  summarise(TotalAssists = sum(AST),\n           TotalTurnovers = sum(TOV), \n           TotalFGM = sum(FGM),\n           TotalFGA = sum(FGA)) |&gt;\n  mutate(AstTovRatio= TotalAssists/TotalTurnovers,\n         AvgFGpct = TotalFGM/TotalFGA)\n\nwithoutHali &lt;- lineup |&gt;\n  filter(TEAM_ABBREVIATION == \"IND\", grepl(\"Haliburton\", GROUP_NAME)== FALSE) |&gt; \n  group_by(TEAM_ABBREVIATION) |&gt;\n  summarise(TotalAssists = sum(AST),\n            TotalTurnovers = sum(TOV), \n           TotalFGM = sum(FGM),\n           TotalFGA = sum(FGA)) |&gt;\n  mutate(AstTovRatio= TotalAssists/TotalTurnovers,\n         AvgFGpct = TotalFGM/TotalFGA)\n\nTeamTovRatio &lt;- lineup |&gt; \n  group_by(TEAM_ABBREVIATION) |&gt;\nsummarise(TotalAssists = sum(AST),\n            TotalTurnovers = sum(TOV), \n           TotalFGM = sum(FGM),\n           TotalFGA = sum(FGA)) |&gt;\n  mutate(AstTovRatio= TotalAssists/TotalTurnovers,\n         AvgFGpct = TotalFGM/TotalFGA)\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=TeamTovRatio, aes(x=reorder(TEAM_ABBREVIATION, AstTovRatio), weight= AstTovRatio), fill= \"lightgrey\") +  \n  geom_bar(data=withHali, aes(x=reorder(TEAM_ABBREVIATION, AstTovRatio), weight= AstTovRatio), fill=\"yellow\") + \n  geom_bar(data=withoutHali, aes(x=reorder(TEAM_ABBREVIATION, AstTovRatio), weight= AstTovRatio), fill =\"blue\") + \n  coord_flip() + theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x =\"\", y = \"Assist/Turnover Ratio\",\n    title = \"Pacers with Haliburton are the best passing team\",\n    subtitle =\"&lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;Without Haliburton,&lt;/span&gt; the Pacers are 10th in Assist/Turnover Ratio. &lt;span style = 'color:yellow;'&gt;With Haliburton,&lt;/span&gt; they are 1st.\",\n    caption =\"Source: Hoopr | By Evan Preuss\" ) +  \n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(), \n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"), plot.title.position = \"plot\", \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaliburton is not only the most efficient passer in the NBA but also makes his team the most efficient distributing team in the NBA. The Indiana Pacers have the best assist to turnover ratio at 2.47. With Haliburton in the lineup the assist to turnover ratio is 2.64; without him it is 2.09.

Out of all players with a third of the team’s assists when on the court, Haliburton has the least turnovers in 100 possessions. Advanced metrics seem to also favor Haliburton. However, many NPCs have argued that he is too inconsistent and gets worse as the season continues.\n\n\nCode\nsplits &lt;- allstar |&gt; \n  mutate(TOperGame = TOV/G, AstTovRatio =`AST/G`/TOperGame)    |&gt; select(Player, Value, AstTovRatio) |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Value, values_from = AstTovRatio)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(data =splits, aes(y=Player, x=Pre, xend= Post),\n    size = 2,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"yellow\",\n    colour_xend = \"blue\") + theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Assist to Turnover Ratio\", \n    y=\"\",\n    title=\"Player's passing efficiency splits during the season\", \n    subtitle=\"The best passers assist to turnover ratio &lt;span style = 'color:yellow;'&gt;before&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; the allstar break is not close.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Evan Preuss\"\n    ) +  theme(plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle= element_textbox_simple(), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaliburton started this season with the same hamstring injury that affected him at the end of last season. Now he is fully healthy and playing better than ever. After the all-star break, Haliburton is showcasing historic numbers with a 9.25 assist to turnover ratio. He is currently on pace to have the third highest assist to turnover ratio ever in a season while averaging 9.2 assists per game."
