    "section": "",
    "text": "The NBA sparks major debates on who is the best player, scorer, defender, rebounder, passer, and more. This season, Tyrese Haliburton is the best and most efficient passer in the NBA. He has the highest assist to turnover ratio out of everyone with more than 10 games played at 5.4.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(zoo)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nnba &lt;- read_csv(\"nbaadvanced.csv\")\ntotals &lt;- read_csv(\"nbatotals.csv\")\npergame &lt;- read_csv(\"nbapergame.csv\")\ntov &lt;- read_csv(\"nbaplaybyplay.csv\")\nlineups &lt;-  nba_leaguedashlineups(league_id = '00', season = year_to_season(most_recent_nba_season() - 1))\nper36 &lt;- read_csv(\"nbaper36.csv\")\nallstar &lt;- read_csv(\"Preandpostallstar.csv\")\n\nAstTov &lt;- pergame |&gt; inner_join(nba, by=c(\"Player\")) |&gt; select(Player, GS.x, G.x, MP.x, AST, TOV, `AST%`, `TOV%`, `USG%`, OWS, WS, WS/48) |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; rename(G = G.x, MP=MP.x, GS=GS.x) |&gt; \n  filter(MP &gt;=10, `USG%`&gt;=10) |&gt; \n  mutate(AstTovRatio =AST/TOV )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data= AstTov, aes( x=TOV, y=AST, size=`USG%`, color= `USG%`), alpha = .3) + \n  scale_size(range = c(1, 10), name=\"USG%\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=AstTov, aes(x=TOV, y=AST), method=\"lm\", se=FALSE, color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=AstTov, aes(x=TOV, y=AST, label= Player)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Most effective passers in the NBA\",\n    subtitle =\"Tyrese Haliburton is one of the top passers in the NBA with less turnovers on lower usage.\",\n    caption =\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Evan Preuss\"\n  ) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"), axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaliburton is third in assists per game having at least 8% less usage and one and a half less minutes per game than the top six players in assists. He also averages at least 1.5 less turnovers than those six players. He is the greatest decision maker with the ball in his hands. What kind of mistakes do the best passers make in the NBA?\n\n\nCode\ntypes &lt;- tov |&gt; inner_join(totals, by=c(\"Player\", \"MP\")) |&gt;\n  rename(Age= Age.x, Team=Team.x, Pos= Pos.x, G=G.x, GS=GS.x, TurnoverByPass=BadPass, TurnoverByDribble=LostBall) |&gt;     select(Player, Age, Team, Pos, G, GS, MP, OnCourt, `On-Off`, TurnoverByPass, TurnoverByDribble, AST, `eFG%`, PGA )\n\ntoppassers &lt;- types |&gt; filter(AST &gt;= 400) |&gt; arrange(desc(AST)) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"TurnoverBy\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Turnover\") \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data = toppassers, aes(x=reorder(Player, AST), weight = Turnover, fill = Type)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"yellow\",\"blue\")) +\n  coord_flip() + theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The top passers make a lot of mistakes with the ball\", \n    subtitle = \"The two main types of turnovers committed by players with more than 400 assists.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference | By Evan Preuss\",\n    x= \"Most Total Assisst\",\n    y=\"Turnovers\" )+ \n  theme(plot.title.position = \"plot\",  \n        plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"), \n        axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main types of mistakes players make with the ball. The ball gets stolen when in the player’s possession or when passing to another player. Haliburton has the second lowest number of these mistakes out of the top players in assists. The player lower? Tyus Jones who has 222 less assists than him. Haliburton rarely makes dangerous passes or uses excessive dribbles. His decisions translate to less careless play by the Pacers.\n\n\nCode\nlineup &lt;-   lineups[[\"Lineups\"]] |&gt; mutate_at(6:34, as.numeric) \nwithHali &lt;- lineup |&gt; \n  filter(grepl(\"Haliburton\", GROUP_NAME)) |&gt; \n  group_by(TEAM_ABBREVIATION) |&gt;\n  summarise(TotalAssists = sum(AST),\n           TotalTurnovers = sum(TOV), \n           TotalFGM = sum(FGM),\n           TotalFGA = sum(FGA)) |&gt;\n  mutate(AstTovRatio= TotalAssists/TotalTurnovers,\n         AvgFGpct = TotalFGM/TotalFGA)\n\nwithoutHali &lt;- lineup |&gt;\n  filter(TEAM_ABBREVIATION == \"IND\", grepl(\"Haliburton\", GROUP_NAME)== FALSE) |&gt; \n  group_by(TEAM_ABBREVIATION) |&gt;\n  summarise(TotalAssists = sum(AST),\n            TotalTurnovers = sum(TOV), \n           TotalFGM = sum(FGM),\n           TotalFGA = sum(FGA)) |&gt;\n  mutate(AstTovRatio= TotalAssists/TotalTurnovers,\n         AvgFGpct = TotalFGM/TotalFGA)\n\nTeamTovRatio &lt;- lineup |&gt; \n  group_by(TEAM_ABBREVIATION) |&gt;\nsummarise(TotalAssists = sum(AST),\n            TotalTurnovers = sum(TOV), \n           TotalFGM = sum(FGM),\n           TotalFGA = sum(FGA)) |&gt;\n  mutate(AstTovRatio= TotalAssists/TotalTurnovers,\n         AvgFGpct = TotalFGM/TotalFGA)\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=TeamTovRatio, aes(x=reorder(TEAM_ABBREVIATION, AstTovRatio), weight= AstTovRatio), fill= \"lightgrey\") +  \n  geom_bar(data=withHali, aes(x=reorder(TEAM_ABBREVIATION, AstTovRatio), weight= AstTovRatio), fill=\"yellow\") + \n  geom_bar(data=withoutHali, aes(x=reorder(TEAM_ABBREVIATION, AstTovRatio), weight= AstTovRatio), fill =\"blue\") + \n  coord_flip() + theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x =\"\", y = \"Assist/Turnover Ratio\",\n    title = \"Pacers with Haliburton are the best passing team\",\n    subtitle =\"&lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;Without Haliburton,&lt;/span&gt; the Pacers are 10th in Assist/Turnover Ratio. &lt;span style = 'color:yellow;'&gt;With Haliburton,&lt;/span&gt; they are 1st.\",\n    caption =\"Source: Hoopr | By Evan Preuss\" ) +  \n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(), \n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"), plot.title.position = \"plot\", \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaliburton is not only the most efficient passer in the NBA but also makes his team the most efficient distributing team in the NBA. The Indiana Pacers have the best assist to turnover ratio at 2.47. With Haliburton in the lineup the assist to turnover ratio is 2.64; without him it is 2.09. Time to get a little more advanced.\n\n\nCode\nnbaast &lt;- nba |&gt; filter(is.na(`AST%`) == FALSE, is.na(`TOV%`) == FALSE) |&gt;\n  filter(MP &gt;=1000)\ntopastpct &lt;- nbaast |&gt; filter(`AST%`&gt;=33.3)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data= nbaast, aes(x=`TOV%`, y=`AST%`)) +\n  geom_point(data= topastpct, aes(x=`TOV%`, y=`AST%`), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=topastpct, aes(x=`TOV%`, y=`AST%`, label= Player)) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Advanced stats show Haliburton is the best passer\", \n    subtitle = \"&lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;Players with 1/3 of the teams assists&lt;/span&gt; while playing usually have a high turnover percentage...\",\n    caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference | By Evan Preuss\",\n    x= \"Turnover %\",\n    y=\"Assist %\",\n  )+  theme(plot.title.position = \"plot\",  \n            plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"), axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssist % tells you what percent of the team’s assists are from the player when in the game. Out of all players with a third of the team’s assists when on the court, Haliburton has the least turnovers in 100 possessions. Advanced metrics seem to also favor Haliburton. However, many NPCs have argued that he is too inconsistent and gets worse as the season continues.\n\n\nCode\nsplits &lt;- allstar |&gt; \n  mutate(TOperGame = TOV/G, AstTovRatio =`AST/G`/TOperGame)    |&gt; select(Player, Value, AstTovRatio) |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Value, values_from = AstTovRatio)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(data =splits, aes(y=Player, x=Pre, xend= Post),\n    size = 2,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"yellow\",\n    colour_xend = \"blue\") + theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Assist to Turnover Ratio\", \n    y=\"\",\n    title=\"Player's passing efficiency splits during the season\", \n    subtitle=\"The best passers assist to turnover ratio &lt;span style = 'color:yellow;'&gt;before&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; the allstar break is not close.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Evan Preuss\"\n    ) +  theme(plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle= element_textbox_simple(), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaliburton started this season with the same hamstring injury that affected him at the end of last season. Now he is fully healthy and playing better than ever. After the all-star break, Haliburton is showcasing historic numbers with a 9.25 assist to turnover ratio. He is currently on pace to have the third highest assist to turnover ratio ever in a season while averaging 9.2 assists per game."
